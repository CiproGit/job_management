# job_management
This project shows an example of the use of singleton pattern in C++. Specifically, one and only one instance of Job_manager class is created; the program shows that in different contexts you always interact with the same object of Job_manager.  
We also defined some exceptions and used the QMultiMap data structure of Qt, which sorts by key.
